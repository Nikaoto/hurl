#### How to play
Requires at least 2 joysticks. It works without them, but you can't play a pvp game with yourself.

Use the joystick left axis to move around and the right axis to move your hand.

Press while holding right trigger to can grab nearby objects. Spin them around and release the grab 
to hurl them at you enemy. 

You can hurl literally anything, even the spiders. 

The spiders chase you if you get near them or if they see you in the blue neon light. Grabbing stuns
them.

Have fun.

#### Controls broken?
If the controls for joysticks are messed up, you can set them by changing 
`/AppData/hurl/joystick_controls.txt`. Mix those numbers around to find the correct axii for 
your joysticks.
